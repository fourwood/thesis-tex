%%%%% INCLUDE PACKAGES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% NOTE: If you want your figure captions, table captions, and bibliography
% items single-spaced (this is permissible for UW theses!), you can use
% the "\fixspacing" command in each of these environments.  This command
% will choose the appropriate spacing, whether you use the "final" or
% "draft" modes.  See the "thesis.cls" class file for details.
% CLARIFICATION: The \fixspacing command has to go inside EACH of your
%     \tablenotetext blocks to be effective

%%%%% SELECTIVE COMPILATION %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Uncomment to prevent the creation of new *.toc *.lot, and *.lof
%   files.  Do this if you need to edit these files for the final
%   version of the paper.  For example, if you have multi-page
%   figures or tables but you want the lists of figures & tables
%   to have only one line for these, you will need to delete the
%   extra lines in the *.lof and *.lot files and re-run LaTeX.
%\nofiles

% Use \includeonly{} if you are just working on one \include{}'d
% section.  This prevents LaTeX from re-processing the unneeded
% chapters, but preserves references and page/fig/table numbers.
% Try it.  You'll like it.
